warm up tasks:
    1.  write a return method called frequency that accepts two parameters: string str and char ch, the method returns the frequency of the ch from the str as an int
            Ex:
                frequency("AAA", 'A') ==>  3
                frequency("ABAB", 'B') ==> 2
            Note: MUST use Arrays and for each loop
            please copy paste the method to the util class
    2. use the above method to create another called uniques that accepts a string paramter and returns it's unique characters as String
            Ex:
                uniques("ABBC");       ==> "AC"
                uniques("Cybertek");   ==> "cybrtk"
                please copy paste the method to the util class
    3. use the methods removeDup and frequency in util class to create a thrid method called frequencyOfChars that can find the frequency of all characters from a string
        Ex:
            frequencyOfChars("AAABBBBCCCC");  ===> A3B4C4
            frequencyOfChars("DDEFJJJ"); ===> D2E1F1J3
methods: grouping a series of code fragments to create a function

        Access-Modifier  Specifier  Return-type  MethodName(Parameter){
                Statements
        }
        Access-Modifier: public, protected, default, private
                public: always accessible
        Specifiers: static, final, abstract, synchronized
                static: can be called through class name
                Arrays.sort
        Return-Type (mandatory): void, DataType
                void: does not return any value
                DataType: MUST return a value
        Parameter: necessary info
                when method is called, it's mandatory to pass argument(s)
Reveiw:
    Array: day 24 & 27
    nested loop: day 22 & 23
    for & while: day 18 & 20
    String: day 15, 16
    if & switch: day 9 , 10, 11
    problem solving:
                1. watch tthre recordings of warmup tasks
                2. Office Hour
1. create a method that can reverse a string
2. identify if a string is palindrome
